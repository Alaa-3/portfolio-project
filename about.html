              I am a Syrian and have been living in Hamburg (Germany) since 2015. When I was in
              Syria, I finished my studies as a surgical assistant, after which I worked in many
              different fields and that taught me how to learn fast and adapt to new work
              environments and situations. In 2012 I flew Syria and moved around many places
              (Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Cyprus and Turkey). In this period, I was working in various
              side-jobs, one of them was working as a finance accountant in an insurance company in
              Turkey, and in 2015 I finally went to Germany and started my life from zero again. In
              2019 I started working as a surgical assistant for a Cosmetic and Hair Transplantation
              clinic.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have always been fascinated by Technology in so many ways because its evolution is
              just remarkable. Many of today|s standard technologies have their origin centuries
              ago, then revolutionized the world and have now become the norm. Then suddenly the
              next big innovation changes our lives and creates a “new normal”. This cycle seems to
              continue over and over, and I want to become a part of it and decent deeper and deeper
              into the rabbithole.
              <br />
              I am the kind of person that doesn’t match any template, that never fits into the box
              but that’s good because I don’t mind stepping out of my comfort zone. I am hungry for
              learning and impatient for life, in love with and motivated by nature, and I am
              somewhat smart and lazy at the same time. But when it’s time for work and doing
              something I am passionate about, I never rest until I am done.
